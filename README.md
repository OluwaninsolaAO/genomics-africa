### Meeting Sign-Up
Meeting sign-up is powered by google forms. We have just hijacked the names
of fields and the action to create our own form. Responses go into a google sheet.

Once a meeting registration is closed we will create a new tab and preserve the
sign-up list from previous meetings in their own tabs.
